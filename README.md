## Credits & Inspiration

##LLM-SQL-Retrieval:
This repository utilizes and extends functionality from João Silva's LLM-SQL-Retrieval repository. https://github.com/jomiguelcarv/LLM-SQL-Retrieval.git  The original repository demonstrated a direct pipeline for SQL retrieval augmented with database schema injection and a self-debugging mechanism for failed queries. For more innovative approaches, check the BIRD Benchmark leaderboard. https://bird-bench.github.io/

##Building Generator (BGD):
This course utilized the BGD Building Generator, provided by Michael T Walsh and Reinhardt Swart, to generate and modify spatial datasets. In our project, these datasets formed the basis for machine learning training to predict acoustic comfort in architectural environments

## Our Project Overview

This project adapts the original retrieval-based pipeline into a specialized design assistant named Ecoform Acoustic Copilot, tailored explicitly for architecture and acoustic design workflows.

## Differences from the Original Repository

UI Integration (ui.py) Architectural Dashboard style:

Developed a graphical user interface using PyQt6.

Interactive visualization of architectural IFC models with enhanced rendering.

Integrated Neo4j browser for intuitive graph visualization and analysis.

Real-time interaction with IFC geometries for dynamic acoustic comfort metrics (e.g., RT60, SPL).

## Main Pipeline (main.py):

Extended the pipeline to handle architectural and acoustic data extracted from IFC files.

Augmented with ML-driven acoustic analysis.

Implemented advanced extraction methods for complex IFC data structures.

Customized LLM prompts specifically for architectural acoustics analysis.

Support for pre-processed JSON and CSV embeddings tailored for acoustic comfort analysis.

# Project Structure

The project maintains a modular and extensible structure:

## server/

config.py: Configuration for cloud/local LLM models.

keys.py (private): Stores API keys securely.

## scripts/

acoustic_pipeline.py: Acoustic analysis workflow.

llm_calls.py: Customized LLM interactions.

neo4j_interface.py: Neo4j database integration.

recommend_recompute.py: Recommendations for recalculations based on IFC changes.

fix_occ_import_error.py: Debugging utility for IFC import issues.

## models/parse/

Stores output JSON or CSV files generated by parsing IFC files for ML-driven analysis.
Stores PKL models

## knowledge/

Embeddings and knowledge bases for retrieval-augmented generation.

## ui.py

Main graphical user interface script integrating visualization and interaction components.

# Getting Started

## Setup

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/<your-repo-link>

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


# Configuration

API Keys: **Navigate to the server/ directory and create a secure keys.py file.**

LLM Configuration: **Modify server/config.py to configure your preferred LLM model (cloud or local).**

## Running the Application

Launch the UI: **python scripts/ui.py**

Parse and Process IFC Models: **python scripts/extract_ifcspace_properties.py**

# Contribute

Added New LLM Calls:

Update scripts/llm_calls.py to add or modify LLM system prompts.

## Adding Knowledge Bases:

Place new JSON or CSV embeddings in the knowledge/ directory.

Refer to our Knowledge-Pool-RAG repository for instructions on generating embeddings.
